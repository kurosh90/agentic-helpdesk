Look for misspellings or unusual domain names.\n3.  **Check for poor grammar and spelling.** Phishing emails are often poorly written.\n4.  **Be wary of urgent or threatening language.** Phishing emails often try to scare you into taking immediate action.\n5.  **Contact the organization the email is supposedly from.** Use a phone number or website you know to be legitimate, and ask if they sent the email.\n6.  **Report the email as phishing.** Most email providers have a way to report phishing emails. This helps them improve their spam filters.\n7.  **Reset your password.** It's a good idea to reset your password as a precaution, especially if you think you may have clicked a link or entered your password on a fake website. See the article \"Password reset, self service steps\" - Use the self service portal to reset your password. If MFA is unavailable, request a temporary bypass via the IT helpdesk ticketing form. After reset, sign out on all devices and sign in again.\n8.  **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).** This adds an extra layer of security to your account.\n\nIf you're still concerned, I can create a ticket for you so that our security team can investigate. The title will be \"User received suspicious email requesting password\", description will be \"User received a suspicious email asking for their password and requires assistance in identifying if it is a phishing attempt and what actions to take.\", and the priority will be P2.
